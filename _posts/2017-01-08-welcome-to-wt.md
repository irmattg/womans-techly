![](img/wt-has-arrived.jpg)



**It's 2017!** My goal was to launch this site before the end of 2016 but thought about it and decided to hold off till 2017. Really excited to get this blog off the ground, even if it reaches **1 person or 100 people** I'm still extremely happy to be sharing some women I know personally and other women who I'm excited to get to know along with you all!

This blog is for **inspiration, motivation and a little of community within the tech space.**  This year it's a time to support each other and work together to make a chance. I hope that connections are made between visitors and individuals who are featured in blog posts.

Make sure to bookmark and come back weekly for a peek at a woman in tech. If you may have any feedback on the setup of this blog, please let me know :)

Also the *sky is the limit* with this blog!
