title: What is WomansTechly?
---
<h1>The Inspiration Behind WT</h1>

<p>A little backstory on WomansTechly - it goes something like this…I was lucky enough to attend the amazing Lesbians Who Tech conference in NYC back in September of 2016. Now, this was my first tech conference where I was surrounded by queer women, allies and women from all different backgrounds under one roof so I was both nervous and excited. The nervousness quickly vanished as I interacted and sat in the audience of many accomplished women. The women who volunteered to speak at the conference were from different backgrounds in tech and what really bothered me was that I had not heard of any of them!</p>

<p>All the women that I met and that I heard share their stories of their careers in tech and the impact they've made was truly inspiring. And I had this itching thought of, if these women are motivating me to make some change, how many more would feel the same if only they had been here?!</p>

<p>After I returned from the trip I knew that I wanted to share these ladies and more with the community. I then settled on making a blog featuring these women! At first I was leaning towards 1 story every 2 weeks but then I was like, “No! One story a week would be perfect.” There are a ton of women out there paving the way for some of us trying to break into the tech sphere and everyone needs to hear their journeys.</p>

<p>Stick around for a weekly update featuring a lady in tech you may have no heard about yet and share them with others. I believe that being involved or aware of each other’s journeys is only a beneficial thing.</p>

<p>This blog will start out with more topics in the developer arena  but I hope to expand and cover many different areas and roles in tech. </p>

<p>Let’s tech it out everyone!</p>
